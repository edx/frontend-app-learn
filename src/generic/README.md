## Generic module (src/generic)

This module is a place for code that is not specific to the frontend-app-learning micro-frontend.  It is intended to be reusable and we expect we can extract it to a reusable code repository like Paragon or frontend-platform in the future.

Take care when changing this code that it doesn't take on domain-specific logic.
